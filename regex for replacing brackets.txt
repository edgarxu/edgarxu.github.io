find		(.*)(\[)(\d*)(\])


replace		$1$3.





    We are using regex capture groups to allow us to retain some parts of the search string whilst replacing other parts.

    The first capture group (.*) searches for and captures anything preceeding the first ( character.

    The second capture group (\() gets the left parenthesis - which we will replace with a {. Notice that the ( is escaped, because ( is an operator in regex

    The third capture group (.*) grabs whatever is inside the parentheses - we will put that back again.

    The final capture group (\)) grabs the ) char, which we swap out for a }

    So, $2 and $4 capture groups contain the ( and ) characters, which we replace with literal { and } characters. (If we wanted to put back exactly what we had found, we would put: $1$2$3$4 as the replace text)
